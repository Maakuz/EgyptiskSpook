All renderers and other classes using shader handler will have to "book" keys,
key id has two numbers, xy, x = the class book id, and y is just a random number
the class chooses. Starting from zero is the cool way.

(Vertex, Pixel and Geometry uses seperate keys, but if they are used togheter, having the
same y is considered good practice!)

BOOK IDs HERE, if u dont new renderers will prolly crash!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
